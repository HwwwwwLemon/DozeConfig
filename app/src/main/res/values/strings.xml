        Doze module. \nWe will obtain some privacy-related permissions to ensure the normal operation of the
        application:\n👉1, storage read and write permissions (read whitelist and log files)\n👉2, read application list
        permissions (read application list )\n👉3, Root permission (optimized whitelist)\nIf you encounter any problems
        (such as bugs, program crashes, etc.) during use, you can submit an issue on GitHub or privately write to me in
